# Temperature vs Natural Gas Volatility for US Cities 
For this project, our group analyzed how the volatility of the natural gas futures market correlates with temperature in the top 10 residential consumption cities in the US. In our dashboard, we have included a heat map of residential natural gas consumption, a synchronized	chart of temperature and average true range (volatility indicator), and a pie chart showing natural gas consumption relative to total US residential consumption. Specifically, we have focused on Winter (December-February) and Summer (June-August) because of the temperature extremes during those periods.
