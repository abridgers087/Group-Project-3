# Temperature vs Natural Gas Volatility for US Cities 
For this project, our group analyzed how the volatility of the natural gas futures market correlates with temperature in the top 10 residential consumption cities in the US. In our dashboard, we have included a temperature chart which uses an arearange series in combination with a line series, futures price chart which uses a candlestick chart, and a futures ATR chart which uses a basic line chart.  In our case, the temperature chart arearange series is used to visualize the high to low temperature range per day, while the line series shows the average temperature per day, the futures price candlestick chart shows the futures open, high, low, and close prices per day, and the ATR basic line chart shows the ATR per day. Specifically, we have focused on Winter (December-February) because of the temperature extremes during those periods.
